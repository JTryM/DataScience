  <h4>Machine learning: the problem setting</h4>
  <a>IN general, a learning problem considers a set of X examples of data and then tries to predict properties os inknow data. I f eacg sample is more than a single number and, for instance, a multi-dimensional entry (aka multivariable data), it is said to have several attributes or features</a>
  <p>Learning problems fall into a few categories:
  *-Supervised learning, in wich data comes with additional attributes that we want to predictc (clic here to go to the scikit-lean supervised learning page). THis problem can be aither
  <!--Clsification: sam-->
  <!--regression-->
 *-Unsupervised learning, in wich the trainin g data consist of a set of input vectors x without any correspondin target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups o similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determinate the distribution of data within the input space, know as density estimation, or to project the distribution of data within the input space, know as a density estimation, or to project the distribution of dta within the input space, , or to a project the data from high- dimensional space down to two our three dimensions for the purpose of visulization(Click here to go to the Scikit-Learn unsupervised learnin page).

  <p>Training set and testing set 
  Machine learning is about learning some properties of a data set and then tetsing those properties against another data set. A common practice in machine learning is to evaluate an algorithm by splittindg a data set into two. We call one of those sets the training set, on wich we learn some properties; we call the other set the testing set, on wich we test the learned properties.</p>

   <p> macine learning is the study of computer algorithmms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as part of Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicity. programmed to do so.[2] </p>  </div>
